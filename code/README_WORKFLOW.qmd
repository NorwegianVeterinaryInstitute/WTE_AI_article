# Workflow scripts

1.  Metadata and aknowledgments: `PRE_collate_raw_metata_aknowlegments.qmd`

-   collates metadata for isolates
-   link to previously collated metadata for all trees to get back the isolate name
-   collates aknowledgments for isolates

2. Data check - included in the phylogenetic tree



3.  Visualisation phylogenetic tree:

- [x]   `SEP_H5N1_HA_phylogenetic_tree.qmd`
- [x]     `PRERUN_SEP_H5N1_NA_phylogenetic_tree.qmd` - where I select what to filter out (mammals and eventually other isolates on the tree)
- [ ]   `SEP_H5N1_NA_phylogenetic_tree.qmd`
- [x]   `SEP_H5N5_HA_phylogenetic_tree.qmd`
- [x]   `SEP_H5N5_NA_phylogenetic_tree.qmd`

6.  (last) Preparation metadata and aknowledgments for publication: `POST_preparation_aknowledgments_metadata_for_publication.qmd`

# check list of what needs to be done before publication

Metadata to include
- [ ] all trees 
- [ ] preparation files for MSA 
- [ ] removed sequences for H5N1 HA

Acknowledgements and formating checks
