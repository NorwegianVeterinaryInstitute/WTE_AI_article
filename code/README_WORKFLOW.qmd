-   collates aknowledgments for isolates

2. Data check - included in the phylogenetic tree



3.  Visualisation phylogenetic tree:

- [x]   `SEP_H5N1_HA_phylogenetic_tree.qmd`
- [x]     `PRERUN_SEP_H5N1_NA_phylogenetic_tree.qmd` - where I select what to filter out (mammals and eventually other isolates on the tree)
- [ ]   `SEP_H5N1_NA_phylogenetic_tree.qmd`
- [x]   `SEP_H5N5_HA_phylogenetic_tree.qmd`
- [x]   `SEP_H5N5_NA_phylogenetic_tree.qmd`

6.  (last) Preparation metadata and aknowledgments for publication: `POST_preparation_aknowledgments_metadata_for_publication.qmd`
